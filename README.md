# Campus-Paths

Campus Paths is a web app developed with various tools and technologies. This application lets the user choose any two buildings at the University of Washington, Seattle, and then shows the shortest path between those two buildings to the user. 

This application runs using react and typescript on the front end, while using Java and an Apache Spark Server on the backend. For finding the shortest path, this application first does a BFS (Breadth first search) and Dijktra's Algorithm to choose the shortest pathbetween the buildings!
